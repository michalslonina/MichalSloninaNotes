# Minecraft hacking for kids

There are several ways how you can leverage Minecraft to teach kids how to program:

- Python MCPI API - this is a python based solution released with MinecraftPy edition but works with Java edition too via Craftit/Bukkit/Raspberry Juice server plugin.
- Minecraft Educational Edition - a premium solution by Microsoft
- Minecraft modding via Craftit/Bukkit server API - This solution is the most powerful and allows you to code in Java or Jython.
- Minetest - minetest is lua based, the entire game is open source and you can modify any aspect of it

## MCPI API

MCPI API allows quite a lot of freedom when modifing the minecraft world and is quite easy to get started.

There are 3 solutions how you can deploy MCPI API in minecraft:

- Craftit/Bukkit RaspberryJuice plugin - https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/raspberryjuice
- ModForge RaspberryJamMod - https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod-minetest
- MineTest RaspberryJamMod-MineTest - https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod-minetest

It is important to understand that not every plugin supports entire MCPI API.
The differences are summarized here:

The documentation for MCPI API can be found here:
